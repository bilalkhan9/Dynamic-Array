## Description
The Dynamic Array Problem Solver is a program designed to tackle the dynamic array problem, which involves managing an array that can dynamically resize itself as elements are added or removed. This program implements efficient algorithms to handle dynamic arrays, ensuring optimal performance and memory usage.

## Features
Dynamic Resizing: Automatically resizes the array as needed to accommodate new elements or remove existing ones.
Efficient Insertion and Deletion: Implements algorithms to efficiently insert elements at the end of the array, remove elements, and resize the array when necessary.
Memory Management: Optimizes memory usage by reallocating memory dynamically based on the current size of the array.
Error Handling: Provides error handling mechanisms to detect and handle out-of-memory conditions or other errors that may occur during array operations.
## Usage
Initialization: Initialize the dynamic array with an initial size or let it start with a default size.
Insertion: Insert elements into the array using appropriate insertion methods (e.g., push_back() for adding elements at the end).
Deletion: Remove elements from the array using deletion methods (e.g., pop_back() for removing elements from the end).
Access: Access elements in the array using indexing or iterators.
Resizing: Allow the array to resize itself dynamically as needed when the capacity is exceeded or when elements are removed.
Examples
Adding Elements: Add elements to the dynamic array, observing how it resizes itself to accommodate the new elements.
Removing Elements: Remove elements from the array and observe how it adjusts its size and memory allocation accordingly.
Accessing Elements: Access individual elements in the array and iterate over the array to perform operations on all elements.
## Implementation
The Dynamic Array Problem Solver is implemented in [programming language], using dynamic memory allocation and appropriate data structures to manage the array efficiently. It may include one or more source files containing the implementation of dynamic array algorithms and related functionalities.
